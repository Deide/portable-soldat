</font>
<font face="Courier" size="4">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dedicated server is used to run a faster Soldat server
without a player.<br>
You can do this in two ways:<br>
1. In the <i>SOLDAT.INI</i> file, section <i>NETWORK</i>, find <i>Dedicated=0</i>,
change it to <i>Dedicated=1.</i></p>
<p>2. Run the game with the parameter
-dedicated (Soldat.exe -dedicated). You can use the shortcuts in the Start Menu<br>
&nbsp;If you want the server to start the game automatically do this:<br>
&nbsp;- Run the game normally and enter the menu. Set all the game options (game
mode, time limit, map list etc.)<br>
&nbsp;- Quit the game and the settings will be saved<br>
&nbsp;- Run Soldat with parameters -dedicated -start</p>
<p><b>Remote administration</b></p>
<p>Players from outside the server can control it. To give this option to a
player add him to the Remote Admins list.<br>
The commands for this are described here

<p><b>Game Ports</b></p>
</font>
<font face="Courier" size="3">
<p>Important! - If you have a firewall you should open the UDP game ports <br>
default: 23073 for the server (can be changed in Soldat Setup) , client uses a default port: 23083
(can't be changed)<br>
There is an option to join
firewall servers without opening the ports, but only through the lobby server
(through the server list - forwarding).</p>
</font>
</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier" size="3"><font face="Courier" size="3"><font face="Courier" size="3">The Soldat server uses the following ports:<br>
  UDP: game port (default 23073)<br>
  TCP/IP: admin port = game port (default 23073)<br>
  TCP/IP: files port = game port + 10 (default 23083) <br>

</font><font face="Courier" size="3">
<font size="4">
<p><font face="Courier">The Soldat network Anti-Cheat Protection is based on two
modules.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier">&nbsp;Software company's developing multiplayer games
spend millions of dollars, hundreds of hours, <br>
the work of thousands of people are wasted to invent the perfect anti-cheat
systems. All those systems are as good<br>
as nothing because they forgot about one tiny little thing. The author of Soldat got
the idea after 4 seconds of thinking.<br>
Now Sierra and other On-Line industry giants can't stand it that they didn't
think of it first. The first <br>
Anti-Cheat Protection module in Soldat is simply:</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier">I. <br>
&nbsp;A request: <b>"Please don't cheat while playing Soldat"</b>.</font></p>
<p>If that somehow doesn't work then please read this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier">II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Because of the Anti-Cheat protection system used in Soldat you <br>
cannot use any hack tools like: memory finders, trainers, packet <br>
editors, hex editors and dissasemblers while Soldat is running. It is <br>
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to CLOSE all programs running in <br>
the background while Soldat is on. The use of hack tools will <br>
degrade the game to a level it will no longer be playable.<br>
</font>Also editing the executable or other related files and cracking<br>
the shareware protection will cause system instability and problems <br>
with network play.<font face="Courier"><br>
If this happens to you and you are sure you did not do anything<br>
illegal please contact the author.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier">&nbsp;Please remember that this is a small shareware
game made by one man. If you try to break the game protection you<br>
make harm to yourself because I can stop making the game if I'm without money and with
overload of work making new anti-hack and anti-cheat systems all the time. If
you want to hack something please concentrate on big company's like EA Games.
Hacking a big commercial title will prove that you are good, please leave Soldat
alone.</font></p>
