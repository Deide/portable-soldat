ANTI-HACK PROTECTION

Because of the Anti-Cheat protection system used in Soldat you
cannot use any hack tools like: memory finders, trainers, packet
editors, hex editors and disassemblers while Soldat is running. It is
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to CLOSE all programs running in
the background while Soldat is on. The use of hack tools will
degrade the game to a level it will no longer be playable.
Also editing the executable or other related files and cracking
the shareware protection will cause system instability and problems
with network play.
If this happens to you and you are sure you did not do anything
illegal please contact the author.

 Please remember that this is a small shareware game made by one man.
If you try to break the game protection you make harm to yourself
because the author can stop making the game if he's out of money
and with overload of work making new anti-hack and anti-cheat systems
all the time. If you want to hack something please concentrate on
big company's like EA Games. Hacking a big commercial title will
prove that you are good, please leave Soldat alone.
